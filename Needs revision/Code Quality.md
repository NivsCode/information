### Code Quality
#### In any case
* Do not allow bad quality code

#### Before development
##### Taking lead
**Q:** How to decide to take up responsibility?
**A:** Analyze the risks involved. Ones in your control and beyond.
**Q:** What to have planned you have taken up the responsibility?
**A:**
*Action points,*
	- Have a contingency plan.
	- make quality a requirements issue
	- The scope and the quality of the system you produce should be discussed as part of the the systems requirements.
*Something  goes wrong, *
	- If you take responsibility for something, you need to see it through. You are commiting to deliver it on time and with perfect quality. You can not use the situation or a co-worker or a cat as a scapegoat incase something goes wrong. 
	- We can acknowedge what happened, offer+explain solutions and learn from the mistake. 
	- Before taking it up with superior over the fuck-up, we need to have had the conversation with ourself. There might be some points for which we already know the response, they are not worth talking about. Key points to be anwsered in a such a case would be,
		~ What are the alternative solutions that were tried to solve this problem?
		~ What were the problems with each of those
		~ What are the availble options now? What are the pros and cons?

#### During and after development
* if there is insufficient time, board it up.
