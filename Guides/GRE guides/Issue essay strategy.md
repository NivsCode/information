 



a) Restate the issue in a way that makes sense to you.

b) You could also determine what question is being answered by the statement. Creating a question may help you determine your position on the issue. If someone were to ask you this question, would you say yes, no, or maybe?

c) Next, create a statement that expresses the opposing viewpoint, using language similar to that of the original statement.

d) Think about alternative viewpoints. Is there another way to look at this issue? Can you qualify the original recommendation in some way? How can you answer all or some of the questions that you generated earlier?

e) From here, you must decide which point of view to address in your essay. Before you decide, carefully consider the following questions. You will have addressed several of them in the exercises you will perform below.

i) What, precisely, is the central issue?

ii) What precisely are the instructions asking me to do?

iii) Do I agree with all or any part of the claim? Why or why not?

iv) Does the claim make certain assumptions? If so, are they reasonable?

v) Is the claim valid only under certain conditions? If so, what are they?

vi) Do I need to explain how I interpret certain terms or concepts used in the claim?

vii) If I take a certain position on the issue, what reasons support my position?

viii) What examples - either real or hypothetical - could I use to illustrate those reasons and advance my point of view? Which examples are most compelling?

f) Once you have decided on a position to defend, consider the perspectives of others who might not agree with your position. Ask yourself:

i) What reasons might someone use to refute or undermine my position? ii) How should I acknowledge or defend against those views in my essay?

The next step should be listing the main reasons and support for your position. Keep in mind that the GRE readers scoring your response are not looking for a “right” answer—in fact, as far as they are concerned, there is no correct position to take. Instead, the readers are evaluating the skill with which you address the specific instructions and articulate and develop an argument to support your evaluation of the issue.
